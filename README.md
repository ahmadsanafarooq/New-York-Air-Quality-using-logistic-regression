### **Steps I Followed:**
1️⃣ **Data Preparation:**
   - 📊 Handled missing and duplicate values for a clean dataset.
   - 🧹 Transformed time columns (`Start_Date`) into datetime format for time-based analysis.
   - ✂ Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model validation.

2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - 🔍 Visualized categorical data distributions using **Seaborn**.
   - ⏳ Analyzed air quality trends over time with line plots.
   - 🔥 Heatmaps revealed correlations among numerical features.

3️⃣ **Feature Engineering:**
   - ✨ Encoded categorical features with **OneHotEncoder** for machine learning compatibility.
   - 🔧 Scaled and prepared numerical data for better model performance.

4️⃣ **Logistic Regression:**
   - 📈 Trained a Logistic Regression model to classify air quality levels.
   - 💡 Achieved notable performance metrics:
     - **Accuracy:** `X%`
     - **Precision:** `Y%`
     - **Recall:** `Z%`
     - **F1-score:** `W%`

5️⃣ **Metrics and Insights:**
   - ✅ Evaluated model predictions with metrics like **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.**
   - 📉 Predicted probabilities for deeper insights into classifications.
